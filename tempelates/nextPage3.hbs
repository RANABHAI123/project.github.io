        <h2>Exercises</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Low-Impact Cardiovascular Exercises: Engage in low-impact aerobic exercises such as walking, swimming, cycling, or using an elliptical machine to reduce stress on joints while burning calories.</li>
            <li>Water-Based Exercises: Consider water aerobics or swimming, as they provide resistance without putting excessive strain on joints.</li>
            <li>Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises using resistance bands, weight machines, or free weights to build muscle and increase metabolism.</li>
            <li>Chair-Based Exercises: Perform seated exercises or exercises that utilize a chair for support, such as seated leg lifts, arm exercises, and modified yoga poses.</li>
            <li>Mindful Movement: Practice mindful exercises like yoga, tai chi, or gentle stretching to improve flexibility, balance, and body awareness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diet Plan</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Balanced and Portion-Controlled Diet: Focus on a well-balanced diet with controlled portion sizes. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.</li>
            <li>Calorie Deficit: Create a moderate calorie deficit by consuming fewer calories than your body needs for weight loss. Seek guidance from a registered dietitian for a personalized plan.</li>
            <li>Fiber-Rich Foods: Choose high-fiber foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts to promote satiety and regulate digestion.</li>
            <li>Reduced Sugar and Processed Foods: Limit the intake of added sugars, sugary beverages, processed snacks, and fast food, as they contribute to calorie intake without providing substantial nutrients.</li>
            <li>Regular Meal Patterns: Establish regular eating patterns with balanced meals and avoid skipping meals, which can lead to overeating later.</li>
        </ul>
