        <h2>Diet Plan:</h2>

            <li>Balanced Diet: Include a variety of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.</li>
            <li>Fiber-Rich Foods: Opt for high-fiber foods like whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables to promote satiety and regulate digestion.</li>

            <li>Hydration: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support metabolism.</li>

            <li>Proper Form and Technique: Learn the correct form and technique for exercises to maximize effectiveness and minimize the risk of injury.</li>
            <li>Listen to Your Body: Pay attention to your body's signals and adjust exercise intensity or duration accordingly. Rest and recover when needed.</li>
            <li>Sustainable Approach: Aim for sustainable lifestyle changes rather than quick-fix diets. Focus on long-term habits for weight management and overall health.</li>
