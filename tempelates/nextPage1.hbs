        <h1>Underweight Fitness</h1>

        <h2>Exercises:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strength Training: Focus on compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows to build muscle mass and increase overall strength.</li>
            <li>Resistance Training: Incorporate resistance bands or weights into your workout routine to target specific muscle groups and promote muscle growth.</li>
            <li>Cardiovascular Exercises: Engage in aerobic exercises like jogging, cycling, or swimming to improve cardiovascular health without excessive calorie burning.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Diet Plan:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Calorie Surplus: Consume more calories than your body burns to create a calorie surplus. Aim for a balanced diet with a slight increase in calorie intake.</li>
            <li>Nutrient-Dense Foods: Include foods rich in healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and a variety of fruits and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Protein Intake: Ensure sufficient protein intake to support muscle growth. Include sources like lean meats, fish, eggs, dairy products, legumes, and plant-based proteins.</li>
            <li>Regular Meals and Snacks: Eat frequent meals and snacks throughout the day to provide a steady supply of nutrients and prevent excessive fullness during main meals.</li>
            <li>Healthy Fats: Include sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish to increase calorie density.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Precautions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Consult a Healthcare Professional: Before making any significant changes to your exercise or diet plan, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who can provide personalized advice based on your specific needs.</li>
            <li>Gradual Progression: Start with manageable exercise routines and gradually increase the intensity, duration, and weights to avoid excessive strain or injury.</li>
            <li>Rest and Recovery: Allow sufficient rest and recovery between exercise sessions to promote muscle growth and prevent overexertion.</li>
            <li>Hydration: Stay hydrated by drinking an adequate amount of water throughout the day, especially during exercise sessions.</li>
            <li>Monitor Progress: Keep track of your progress by monitoring weight gain, muscle development, and overall well-being. Adjust your exercise and diet plan accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
